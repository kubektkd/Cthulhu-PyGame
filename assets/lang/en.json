    "description": "This scenario is inspired by gloomy Scandinavian novels and series, in which mystery, community and investigation play the main roles. This convention is known as nordic-noir, but the script also refers to famous folk tales and Lovecraft's Dreamland. The action of the game begins in February 2020 somewhere in Scandinavia. The dreamlike atmosphere is built here by a secluded town surrounded by hills and dark forests and a harsh, but charming winter aura. This is a very subtle story that is not an action story."
